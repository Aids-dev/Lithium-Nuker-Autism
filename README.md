# Lithium Nuker 
The Lithium developers took down their download because they are upset about people skidding their nuker. They knew that this would happen after making it public. It's kind of bogus, not gonna lie, but here's a reuploaded version.

dont download the zip in the green buttom that says code download it from the releases.
